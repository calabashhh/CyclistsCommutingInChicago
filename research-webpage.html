            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>How is the physical and the geographical connected to the mental and the emotional? This phenomenological study interviewing urban cyclists in Chicago provide some insight towards answering this exceedingly large query. The bike as multifaceted tool and implement of both physical and mental narration is both transformed and transforms the urban landscape.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="problem" class="section">
            <h2>The Problem and Its Setting</h2>
            <p>The question of "mood", "vibe", "cool" are all extremely subjective categories and ideas none with fully agreed-upon or even fixed definition. Can the physical environment and geography shape our mental space. What if anything is the connection between the two? There are many ways to approach these questions. No matter how one can approach it one must content with the myriad layers and filters of human culture and society. Each approach to this type of inquiry seems to suffer from some aspect of these limitations.</p>
            
            <p>I would also argue that any question or investigation into these types of matters is more a question of poetry than it is a question of science and while perhaps it could be measured ethnographically according to proper social science methods rarely are those methods able to convey any of that poetic essence which is so central to these themes. This is not to say that this type of investigation is not possible nor valuable however if the thrust of the query is interested in the nature of the relationship between human beings and their spatial surroundings, this creates an interesting crux.</p>
            
            <p>The inquiry is balanced between the hard sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities. The interplay of all three, and their specific role, and even hierarchy of methodology within this type of investigation all pose complex challenges.</p>
            
            <p>This studies focus on urban cyclists allows for some way to try to step through this murky morass of competing subjectivities. This narrow focus goes some way towards achieving this breakthrough. Here the bicycle serves as a both a common mediating lens through which the rider is perceiving their environment through; as well as serving as a tool through which the rider shapes and creates the environment around them.</p>
            
            <p>This is partially achieved though the unique status of bicycles as transportation in the context of the American social, legal, and infrastructural structures of the urban environment. This unique placement of this spacial/ temporal/ corporeal experience not quite at the center of of the hegemonic structures around it allow for some sense of perspective to appear. This perspective is certainly enough, quite uncertain; and yet some trace essence peers through the layers obscuring of cultural and social filters. How much and how relevant remain to be seen.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="literature" class="section">
            <h2>Review of Related Literature</h2>
            <p>The literature around this topic is fairly substantial, though cycling does not exist at the same level as say automobile transportation, there is certainly a fair amount of scholarly inquiry into bicycles and the experience of cyclists. Certainly one driving reason for this volume is due to the perception that cycling as a means of transportation is a way to combat or ameliorate the negative affects of anthropocentric climate change. While this is not the focus of this study by any means, and is not always highlighted in the literature (though it is often mentioned), this fact is clearly at least in the background of these studies. The literature reviewed here for this study falls into some major themes.</p>
            
            <p>One theme is that of an interesting investigation into perceptions of cyclists. How are cyclists viewed by both avid cyclists as well as non-cyclists. This type of inquiry takes less of a focus on how the act is experienced and rather is intended to organize and understand why some people bike more than others. Again at the root of this type of inquiry is a desire for how to increase the numbers of people who enjoy cycling as well as increase the amount that cyclists will bike.</p>
            
            <p>Another significant theme in the literature revolves around how to best collect experiential, mood, and other perceptive data, and then how best to utilize this data. This theme is certainly quite intriguing in the abstract, however this type of affective mapping can oftentimes obscure more than it can reveal. Perhaps the reasons for this disconnect is that the technology which measures the senses or which is used to record the mood is often far too precise as compared to the thing or feeling which is being measured. This then leads to a mismatch where mood and perception are given the same treatment as measurement of distance or volume. While the advent of newer and more exciting technologies often make this type of examination quite seductive, it often fails to meet expectations or will succumb to other hazards of gross assumption. For example if a study is asking cyclists to rate the mood of each part of their route and this is recorded in real time and plotted through the means of GIS on a map; we might be deceived into thinking that the mood exists in the landscape and is tied to some physical feature. Whereas, how exactly mood and emotion are connected or unconnected to the landscape is not thoroughly interrogated. Or are mood and experience produced by the subject and it is incorrect to assume that they exist in the physical world waiting for us to walk by and pick them up?</p>
            
            <p>Similar to the first theme, there are also themes in the literature which pertain quite specifically to how to create more cyclists. They have a focus on how people learn to become a cyclist and also the imprecise, sanctioned and yet unsanctioned place of the bicycle and the cyclist in contemporary America's spatial, social, and systemic landscapes. This type of focus seems to take up the most space in the literature, this also makes sense as cycling is generally fit under an urban planning and transformational rubric. This naturally lends itself for a more practical and problem solving goals. While this is acknowledged to be an important facet and does provide some useful background understanding of this population it is not quite the focus of this study.</p>
            
            <p>The final literature theme is much closer to the focus of this study and provided the more direct useful comparisons and guidance. Here method and focus is on personal narration, description of the pathways and the thoughts apparent to the cyclists as they move through their environment on the bicycle. This approach provides many useful aspects such as the noting of an all-encompassing subject matter, including notably the monitoring of the body. The conversion of thought, perception, and experience to the record is of course also fraught with complexities, the mere act of creating a narrative and attempting to fill up space is itself an artificial imposition into the study of the experience.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="methods" class="section">
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>The research approach which this study takes will follow a phenomenological approach. The relationship which is of interest here is that between physical constraints and structure of the environment and the emotional/ mindset pf the human in that space. As that relationship is still quite speculative, we must look to how spaces are experiences and then try to move on from there.</p>
            
            <p>The target population for this study is that of urban cyclists in Chicago, IL. Though this a broad category, the hope is to target people who use bicycles for more than just recreation or exercise but to focus on people who use bikes are part of a commute or to get around, though we will also include their recreational activities. The intended sample of this study is a convenient group recruited through word of mouth, as the researcher is connected to a fairly large number of cyclists in Chicago. The intended sample size was that of a target of 10 participants, due to time constraints and challenges in scheduling interviews this study was conducted with 7 participants. In recruiting possible participants it was made known that the research was specific to city cyclists and the focus was towards those who cycle in order to commute as opposed to cycling for exercise. Though these are certainly overlapping categories, it was not hard to maintain this target in the population.</p>
            
            <p>Due to this convenient sample the location and demographics of this population is generally limited to the north-side of Chicago and to a population in their 30s and 40s. This is naturally understood to be a limiting factor in the wider implications of this study.</p>
            
            <p>This study uses a method of a semi-structured interview. All participants were asked the same questions in roughly the same order though an allowance was made to engage with particular answers and to clarify others as well as follow up on particularly interesting responses. The interview instrument can be seen in the appendix. All interviews were conducted over zoom and the interviews were recorded. A verbal confirmation from each participant was gathered allowing for the interview to be recorded. Each interview was intended to last between 20-40 min and averaged about 25 min each. The recorded interviews were then fed through Otter.ai (a transcription service) this helped in generating transcripts which along with notes taken during the interviews could be cross referenced before being analyzed for content and answers.</p>
            
            <p>The instrument itself took a lot of guidance from the literature, especially the inclusion of questions regarding perceptions of safety while riding. The structure of the instrument was built to try to elicit deeper answers especially for the more cerebral questions. This was attempted by initially structuring the questions around a grounding, historically situated starting point. For example, all participants were asked quite early on what they remember about first learning to ride a bike. Though this recollection was not necessarily a focus of this study, it was placed early on as a way to connect all interviewees to their first relationship with the bicycle. It is hoped that this structuring of the questions would allow for more open and free flowing answers further on in the interview when participants were asked about what they thought about when biking and whether they thought differently when biking vs doing other activities. The recorded transcripts were then transcribed and analyzed. Connections, commonalities, outliers, and themes were identified.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="results" class="section">
            <h2>Results/Discussion</h2>
            <p>There were some generalities to which most or all of the study group exhibited: all 7 rode at least 3 times a week and some did everyday; most did not ride during the winter though some did; everyone mentioned safety being important; most everyone did not stop at stop signs "if they could help it"; most everyone did not ride the wrong way down a one-way street or ride on the sidewalk unless in specific circumstances or to save (to them) significant time or trouble.</p>
            
            <p>All but one of the of the study group when asked what they thought about when riding answered some variation of "everything" or "lots of things". The one who answered otherwise said, "Not much, I'm actually present and in the moment" and described a zen-like blankness or flow. Everyone agreed that they thought differently when biking, though how they did was quite subjective. Everyone also mentioned to differing degrees how much more present or aware of their surroundings they were. All but one of the participants rode with other people at times and that it made them ride differently, many by varying their speed either faster or slower. Interestingly the person who did not ride with other people at all, did mention that they were very conscious about their speed as it related to the speed of cars around them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="themes" class="section">
            <h2>Themes</h2>
            <p>The wealth of data produced in only 7 conversations lasting over 3 hours is immense. Most of it points towards other questions or also towards a desire to speak with more participants. However despite the uncertainly a number of significant themes became apparent.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Route selection</strong> is a significant theme and target of study for this aim. Knowing and thinking and talking about where one bikes to and by which route are significant factors in the experience of riding a bike especially in an urban environment. This study's focus on commuting also drives this as it pairs various destinations with either constant or changing pathways to get there. This wealth of potential data could also be easily gathered via some type of geolocation device. To study the change and frequency of various routes, and even with the right technology capture the route at a micro level. Though expensive, a bike mounted lidar device could map the details of every bump and clear path, measuring potholes and noting exactly where the tread of bike tires passes along and over.</p>
            
            <p>The instrument directly asks about how one <strong>learned to ride a bike</strong> and when. Though most people's memories of this event are cloudy, vague, and fairly simple. Clearly learning and teaching at all levels is going on and is happening in often not directly verbally instructional means. Interviewees both describe teaching (through modeling and guidance as well as being knowledgeable and teaching others. Here the skills being alluded to are often not fully verbal but still exist in a physical, auditory, and visual realm.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Maps and their connection to biking</strong> were more pervasive than I expected. Many participants regularly checked an algorithmically generated digital map/ route suggestion website before embarking on their journey, even destinations to which they regularly commuted to and did so on the same routes on a regular basis. Further inquiry into this phenomena is warranted, though it is certainly outside the scope of this study. In addition participants also made some reference to mental maps. Oftentimes the checking of the digital map was compared with one's own mental map and the person's mental map always seemed to take preference when there was a disagreement.</p>
            
            <p>Another area of emphasis in this interview instrument is that of <strong>sound</strong>. Participants were all asked about whether they intentionally listened to something while they biked, and if so what it was and how they listened to it. The range of differing answers and often opposite or conflicting trends in this area speaks to the intense subjectivity of this area of experience. Often the answer revolved around distraction and either rejecting listening to something because it was itself distracting or deciding that specifically listening to something else would help them not be distracted when biking. As many people reported biking with others, and often sound played a part in making those types of rides distinct an exploration into the sounds of biking and of groups could be quite interesting. While other studies have used portable listening devices to allow the participant to voice their own narration while they rode, using this type of technology could gather the sounds of the ride and these could also be plotted against their route through space.</p>
            
            <p>The dynamics of <strong>group riding</strong>, alluded to above, also opens up for more inquiry and exploration. The relationships between riders and each other as well as their relation to the physical urban environment are also open avenues for study. Many participants spoke of feeling that riding with another person was a very different type of experience and that there were certain differences which were apparent.</p>
            
            <p>Another underlying theme, one which was heavily alluded to in the literature was that of the <strong>embodied or corporeal aspect</strong> of the experience. Here in the use of this bicycle as tool the mental and the physical meet in a unique geography. This is perhaps the most elusive and yet fascinating theme of this study and one which most closely approaches the underlying goal of this endeavor. Certainly a more intensive interview process, perhaps including both a ride along of interviewer and interviewee, or at least some replication of route to more fully immerse within the pathway of the interviewee.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="conclusion" class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Naturally this study is quite limited in many aspects. Much of these limitations are by design, for without any the sprawling unfocused nature of this question is far too broad. Still though a more comprehensive survey of demographic data, especially ages, and locations within the city should be sought. Much of this study is based upon a specifically urban American context. How the embodied experience of bike riding would be experienced in other countries with more, less, and different social and infrastructure landscapes is also a deficiency and an interesting area of further study.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond the desire to learn more about these phenomena and to interview more and different people to gain further understanding of these emerging themes, other applications emerge. Certainly as safety is such an important topic to the population focused on here, new ideas gathered from the years of wisdom can be put to some use. For each biker who investigates this research other things will certainly jump out for a myriad reasons. For myself, the idea of the bell as a way to announce presence was both familiar and yet also revelatory.</p>
            
            <p>How then are we able to think now about the connection between mental and physical geography? It is the narrative nature of the bicycle as tool itself which also speaks to this perspective. It brings together time and space, intertwined with an immediate physical, corporeal yet highly mental and often sensually bombarded experience. This tool is both shaper and measuring stick, yet leaves little physical trace on the landscape; yet still it produces myriad effects felt and experienced. All this deeply intertwined with the dancing relationship between the temporal and the spatial.</p>
